<h1>The Best Movies According to Brandt</h1>
   <h2>My Top 3 movies of all time!</h2>
<hr/>
      <h3>Major League</h3>
		   <p>Release in 1989.  Of the many movies where a group of misfits and hasbeens come together to win the big game, this one resinates with me the most.  A great mix of comedy, drama and emotion.</p>
      <h3>Avengers Infinity War</h3>
         <p>Released in 2018. My favorite Marvel movie.  The Thanos story arc was so good you actually started to consider his point of view as being correct.  The fight scenes in the beginning where the good guys lose were so good (esspecially the NY scene). Of course when Thor arrives in Wakanda you finally thought the tide had turned, but no, they still lose in the end.  What a fun ride.</p>
      <h3>Christmas Vacation</h3>
         <p>Released in 1989. So many Christmas movies exist these days.  I guess this one resinates with me the most because as a Dad in my 40's I can relate to every single scene in this movie.  I feel dads around the world have experienced many of the trials Clark endured in this movie.</p>
